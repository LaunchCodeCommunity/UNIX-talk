 UNIX: an informal introduction to the history, theory, and usage
 ================================================================
## What is this talk about? ##
This talk is about UNIX. In this talk, I'm going to argue it's one of the most important 
pieces of technology that has greatly shaped the 21^st century.
 
## OK, but What is UNIX? ##
(It helps you fight velociraptors)[http://www.tumblr.com/search/unix%20gif]

UNIX is a family of operating systems that was first invented for mainframe 
computers, starting in 1969.
 
## OK, but what is an Operating System? ##
Wikipedia definition: 
*An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software resources 
and provides common services for computer programs.*

List of things that are defined by the OS
 * Input/Output
 * Drivers
 * Install/Update
 * Security

 B. Machine Code and Assembly
 i. Binary calculators
 a) [8800 again, for switches]
 b) Each type of chip had different instruction set
 ii. Assembly as punch cards

 ii. Multiple dumb terminals leads to time-sharing issue
 iii. Text-based interfaces (origin of “print”)
 III. UNIX
 A. Background
 i. Every machine had a custom OS
 a) combo of pre-OS innovations
 b) bundled monitor programs together with other utilities
 ii. No assembly programs could be ported

 iii. Written for PDP-7, then PDP-11, in assembly 
 iv. PDP-11's bought to run UNIX
 C. UNIX in C, 1971 – onwards
 i. C programming language features
 a) Imperative/procedural
 b) Text-based source, compiled to many different assemblies
 ii. UNIX reimplemented in C, 1971 – 1973
 a) The language evolved with the OS
 b) UNIX learned more tricks
 iii. UNIX ported to other mainframes
 a) C compilers learned more assemblies
 b) UNIX code could be ported to them with little work
 c) Code could be shared far more easily
 D. BSD, Linux, and OS X
 i. Bell not allowed to get into computer business
 ii. UNIX cloning
