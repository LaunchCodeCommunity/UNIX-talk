## A Bit of Theory

Like all English majors, I'll begin with the Wikipedia definition:
>An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
>resources and provides common services for computer programs.

UNIX is a family of operating systems (OS) that began as one OS first invented
for mainframe computers, starting in 1969.
It is a platform from which many other technologies have been created,
and it has been the workbench of many programmers past and present.

Elements defined by the OS
* Memory
* Storage
* Installing New Programs
* Updating Old Programs
* Security
* Administration
* Device Drivers for Input/Output (I/O)
* And, it helps you fight velociraptors
