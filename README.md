# UNIX talks
## for LaunchCode

Here is the UNIX talk that was first presented to the CoderGirl meetup in
mid-Feb. It's a bit rough, but I hope to make it first-class material.

The eventual goal is to use CC-licenced graphics and FOSS tools to create a
UNIX environment for interactive learning, and a HTML-based slideshow for
the content.

Anyone can contibute to this, including adding graphics and fixing typos
Thanks!
