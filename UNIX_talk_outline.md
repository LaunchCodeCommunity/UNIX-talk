# UNIX: an informal introduction to the theory, history, and usage

Hello all, sehqlr here, and here is an outline of a lecture to beginning
programmers and technologists that I think will help them in software
development and get a better understanding of your computer in general.

## A long preamble to a tale

I'm going to begin by asking myself a few, easily answered questions, then
conveniently answering them.

#### What is this lecture about?

This lecture is about UNIX, argueably one of the most important technologies
from the 20th century; one that has greatly shaped the 21st. More specifically,
it is a platform from which many other technologies have been created,
and it has been the workbench of many programmers past and present.

#### OK, but what is UNIX?

[Well, It helps you fight velociraptors](//www.tumblr.com/search/unix%20gif)

UNIX is a family of operating systems (OS) that began as one OS first invented
for mainframe computers, starting in 1969.

#### OK, but what is an Operating System?

Like all English majors, we begin with the Wikipedia definition:
>An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
>resources and provides common services for computer programs.

Elements defined by the OS
* Input
* Output
* Memory
* Storage
* Installing New Programs
* Updating Old Ones
* Security
* Administration
* Device Drivers
* etc

#### A story at my family's expense

#### Thesis
The what, the history, and the why of OS
UNIX's influence and pervasiveness (INTERNET)
Why it matters to me

## A Brief History

#### pre-UNIX OS

1. Early Hardware: toggles and knobs, paper tape and punch cards (and magnets!)
  1. [Altair 8800](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800

  2. [Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer

  3. [Paper tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape

  4. [Punch cards](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card

  5. [Teletypewriters (TTY)](//heritageinmaine.blogspot.com/2011/10/
     not-hearing-history-at-governor-baxter.html)
2. Resource management and automation leads to OS technology
  1. Computers got faster and important, so 'moniter' programs were written
  2. Multiple programmers lead to time-sharing issues, especially after TTY
  3. Machine -> Low Level -> High Level
  4. OS just a combo of earlier innovations bundled together

#### UNIX, C, and \*nix systems

Highlights from [DMR's UNIX Notes](//cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/notes.html)

1. UNIX
  1. Bell Labs R&D project
  2. Implemented in assembly, 1969 - 1971
  3. Reimplemented in C, 1971 â€“ 1973
2. C programming language
  1. Imperative/procedural paradigm
  2. Text-based source, compiled to many different assemblies
  3. The language evolved with UNIX, made it portable and shareable
3. \*nixes: BSD, Linux, and OS X
  1. [BSD](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bsd_daemon.jpg
     #mediaviewer/File:Bsd_daemon.jpg)
  2. [Darwin (OS X)](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hexley_the_Platypus.svg

  3. [Linux](//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tux.svg

  4. [GNU](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heckert_GNU_white.svg

## Usage: the almighty Terminal

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  1. This is how most people use computers
  2. most of the OS details are hidden
  3. Takes UI/UX design, and is easy to get wrong
  4. Instructions rely on spacial descriptions or screenshots
2. Text-based User Interfaces
  1. Geared towards knowledgeable 'power users'
  2. Reveals many more details, sometimes badly
  3. No UI/UX design, unless you use ASCII art
  4. Instructions can be literally copy & pasted, even downloaded

This is an area many people don't venture, but it gives you power
