# UNIX: an informal introduction to the history, theory, and usage

Hello all, I'm sehqlr, and here is an outline of a lecture to beginning
programmers and technologists that I think will help you in software
development and get a better understanding of your computer in general.

## What is this lecture about?
This lecture is about UNIX, argueably one of the most important technologies
from the 20th century; one that has greatly shaped the 21st. More specifically,
it is a platform from which many other technologies have been created,
and it has been the workbench of many programmers past and present.

## OK, but what is UNIX?
[It helps you fight velociraptors](http://www.tumblr.com/search/unix%20gif)

UNIX is a family of operating systems (OS) that began as one OS first invented
for mainframe computers, starting in 1969.

## OK, but what is an Operating System?
Wikipedia definition:
>An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
>resources and provides common services for computer programs.

List of pairs that are defined by the OS
* Input/Output
* Memory/Storage
* Install/Update
* Security/Administration

## A story at my family's expense

## Thesis
The what, the history, and the why of OS
UNIX's influence and pervasiveness (INTERNET)
Why it matters to me

## Brief pre-UNIX OS history

1. Early Hardware
  1. Toggles and knobs, paper tape and punch cards (then magnets!)
  2. [Colossus](http://www.colossus-computer.com/images/030109-01-1.jpg)
  3. [Altair 8800](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800#mediaviewer/

2. Machine Code and Assembly
  1. Binary calculators
  2. Each type of chip had different instruction set
  3. [Assembly as punch cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card
     #mediaviewer/File:IBM1130CopyCard.agr.jpg)
  4. Assembly is abstraction from binary
  5. Many different dialects, for each instruction set
3. Better tech leads to TTY and timesharing
  1. [Teletypewriters (TTY)](http://heritageinmaine.blogspot.com/2011/10/
     not-hearing-history-at-governor-baxter.html)
  2. Multiple dumb terminals leads to time-sharing issue
  3. Text-based interfaces (origin of “print”)
4. Operating Systems are born
  1. OS just a combo of earlier innovations
  2. Written in assembly

## UNIX

[DMR's UNIX Notes](http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/notes.html)

UNIX Written for PDP-7, then PDP-11, in assembly, 1969 - 1971
UNIX reimplemented in C, 1971 – 1973
C programming language
* Imperative/procedural paradigm
* Text-based source, compiled to many different assemblies
* The language evolved with UNIX, made it portable

c) Code could be shared far more easily
D. BSD, Linux, and OS X
i. Bell not allowed to get into computer business
ii. UNIX cloning
iii. BSD
iv. Linux
v. Darwin (OS X)
E. UNIX today
i. Desktops
ii. Mobile/Embedded Devices
iii. Servers/Containers
iv. Supercomputers
v. EVERYTHING
IV. Conclusion


B. Wrapping up
C. Antithesis: OS will continue to evolve, and UNIX with it
