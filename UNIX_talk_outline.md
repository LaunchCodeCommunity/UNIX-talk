# UNIX: an informal introduction to the history, theory, and usage

Hello all, I'm sehqlr, and I've been invited to present a talk to you beginning
programmers and technologists that I think will help you in software
development and get a better understanding of your computer in general.

## What is this talk about?
This talk is about UNIX, and I'm going to argue it's one of the most important
pieces of technology from the 20th century that has greatly shaped the 21st.

## OK, but What is UNIX?
[It helps you fight velociraptors](http://www.tumblr.com/search/unix%20gif)

UNIX is a family of operating systems (OS) that began as one OS first invented
for mainframe computers, starting in 1969.

## OK, but what is an Operating System?
Wikipedia definition:
>An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
>resources and provides common services for computer programs.

List of things that are defined by the OS
* Input/Output
* Drivers
* Install/Update
* Security

* The Sims
* XP netbook in college
* CS50x and LaunchCode

C. Thesis
i. The what, the history, and the why of OS
ii. UNIX's influence and pervasiveness (INTERNET)
iii. Why it matters to me
## Brief pre-UNIX history
A. Early Hardware
i. Toggles and knobs, paper tape and punch cards (then magnets!)

B. Machine Code and Assembly
i. Binary calculators
b) Each type of chip had different instruction set
[ Assembly as punch cards ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card#mediaviewer/File:IBM1130CopyCard.agr.jpg)
b) Assembly is abstraction from binary
c) Many different dialects, for each instruction set
C. Pre-OS innovations
i. Faster computation
ii. Signals to machine operators
iii. Monitor programs
D. TTY and timesharing
[Teletypewriters (TTY)](http://heritageinmaine.blogspot.com/2011/10/not-hearing-history-at-governor-baxter.html)
ii. Multiple dumb terminals leads to time-sharing issue
iii. Text-based interfaces (origin of “print”)
III. UNIX
A. Background
i. Every machine had a custom OS
a) combo of pre-OS innovations
b) bundled monitor programs together with other utilities
ii. No assembly programs could be ported
B. UNIX in assembly, 1969 – 1971

iii. Written for PDP-7, then PDP-11, in assembly 
iv. PDP-11's bought to run UNIX
C. UNIX in C, 1971 – onwards
i. C programming language features
a) Imperative/procedural
b) Text-based source, compiled to many different assemblies
ii. UNIX reimplemented in C, 1971 – 1973
a) The language evolved with the OS
b) UNIX learned more tricks
iii. UNIX ported to other mainframes
a) C compilers learned more assemblies
b) UNIX code could be ported to them with little work
c) Code could be shared far more easily
D. BSD, Linux, and OS X
i. Bell not allowed to get into computer business
ii. UNIX cloning
iii. BSD
iv. Linux
v. Darwin (OS X)
E. UNIX today
i. Desktops
ii. Mobile/Embedded Devices
iii. Servers/Containers
iv. Supercomputers
v. EVERYTHING
IV. Conclusion

B. Wrapping up
C. Antithesis: OS will continue to evolve, and UNIX with it
